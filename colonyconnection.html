 <h1>Colony Connection</h1>
 <p>Suppose you are living in 2098, NASA already reached on Mars and established several colonies over there but water supply system is not so good implemented.
so NASA hired you to solve this problem you are given N pairs of cordinates(x,y) representing N colonies numbered 1,2,3,4,.......,N.
And already implemented K connections (each given as a pair of coloney's number like if a pipeline is there between colony 3 and 4 then it is represented as (3,4) or (4,3) ).
  </p>
  <p>
However, NASA want to guarantee that every Colony should be connected from every other colony either directly or via some other colony. the cost of pipeline between any two colony (let say colony i and j) will be (Xj-Xi)^2 + (Yj-Yi)^2 .
you need to minimize the cost of implementing new pipelines and connect all the colonies either directly or via some other colony..</p>
